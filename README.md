## Implementation

The TodoApp was created with the help of TypeScript and React, and test for the todo app were done with unit test help of 
Jest and React testing library.

While creating the TodoApp I realised that my implementation of of the app cound have been done better by dividing in 
the code into more component for readabilities sake. 

### Get  Started

This project can be cloned from the github repository and after the cloning is done, you will have to 
enter `npm install` for downloading the neccessary dependencies that are required for the TodoApp to run, this will take a minute or two, so go and grab a cup of coffee while you wait.

When the dependencies are downloaded you can start the TodoApp by entering `npm start` from the terminal.

If you want to run the unit tests enter `npm test` in the terminal.

Have fun.
