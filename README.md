## Implementation

The TodoApp was created with the help of TypeScript and React, and test for the todo app were done with unit test help of 
Jest and React testing library.

While creating the TodoApp I realised that my implementation of of the app cound have been done better by dividing in 
the code into more component for readabilities sake.
